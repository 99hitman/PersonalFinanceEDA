# PersonalFinanceEDA

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in personal finance involves using statistical and visual methods to analyze financial data and gain insights into individual or household financial situations. 
It involves data collection, cleaning and preprocessing, descriptive statistics, use of visualization.
EDA provides insights that can inform better financial decision-making. It helps in budgeting, setting financial goals, optimizing spending, and making informed investment choices.

Following are the names of the files for this dashboard:
DataSet.xlsx --> Dataset of personal Finance
